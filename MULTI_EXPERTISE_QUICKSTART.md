# Quick Start: Multiple Expertise & Tags Feature

## What's New? ðŸŽ‰

### 1. Multiple Expertise Selection
Mentors can now select **multiple expertise areas** instead of just one!

**Example**: A mentor can be both a "Career Coach" AND a "Programming Expert"

### 2. Granular Skill Tags
After selecting expertise areas, mentors can specify **exact skills** they teach:
- Career Coaching â†’ Resume Writing, Interview Prep, LinkedIn Optimization
- Programming & Tech â†’ Python, React, Machine Learning, etc.
- And 70+ other specific tags across 8 expertise categories!

## How It Works

### For Mentors (Onboarding Phase 1)
1. **Select Expertise Areas** (multiple allowed):
   - Click cards to select/deselect
   - Green checkmark shows selected areas
   - Can select as many as relevant

2. **Choose Specific Skills** (appears after selecting expertise):
   - Toggle skill tags on/off
   - Shows combined tags from all selected expertise
   - Counter displays how many skills selected

### For Students (Search)
- Search by specific skills (e.g., "Python", "Resume Writing")
- Get more precise results
- See exactly what each mentor specializes in

## Files Changed

1. **Form Schema**: `src/hooks/useExpertOnboardingForm.ts`
   - Changed `category` from string to array
   - Added `expertiseTags` array field

2. **UI Component**: `src/components/onboarding/BasicInfoStep.tsx`
   - Multi-select expertise cards
   - New tag selection section
   - Added 70+ skill tags across 8 categories

3. **Service Layer**: `src/services/expertProfileService.ts`
   - Handles array data types
   - Backward compatible with old format

4. **Database**: `supabase/migrations/20251028000000_add_multiple_expertise_support.sql`
   - New `categories` (text[]) column
   - New `expertise_tags` (text[]) column
   - GIN indexes for fast array searches
   - Enhanced search function with tag matching

## Database Migration Required

Run this migration on your Supabase instance:
```bash
# The migration file is already created at:
supabase/migrations/20251028000000_add_multiple_expertise_support.sql
```

This will:
- âœ… Add new columns
- âœ… Migrate existing data
- âœ… Create performance indexes
- âœ… Update search functions
- âœ… Add helper functions
