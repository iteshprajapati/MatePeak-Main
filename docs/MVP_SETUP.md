## 🗄️ Database Tables

1. **profiles** - User base information
2. **user_roles** - Role management (admin, user, expert)
3. **expert_profiles** - Mentor details
4. **bookings** - Session bookings
5. **reviews** - Mentor reviews
6. **messages** - Direct messaging
7. **categories** - Mentor categories
8. **wallets** - Mentor wallets
9. **wallet_transactions** - Transaction history
10. **mentor_embeddings** - AI search vectors

## 🔑 Required Secrets

Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Edge Functions:

- ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI search (already configured)
- ⏳ `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing (optional, can use test mode)

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Enable pgvector Extension**
To enable AI-powered search:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Extensions
2. Search for "vector" or "pgvector"
3. Click Enable
4. Run the vector search migration (will be provided separately)

### 2. **Payment Integration** (Optional for MVP)
- Stripe integration ready (Lovable has native support)
- Currently using payment status tracking only
- Webhook integration needed for production

### 3. **Meet Link Integration**
- Currently generating placeholder links: `https://meet.matepeak.com/{id}`
- Integrate with:
  - Google Meet API
  - Zoom API
  - Jitsi (open-source)
  - Or custom video solution

### 4. **Frontend Development**
Build pages for:
- Student dashboard (view bookings, search mentors)
- Mentor dashboard (view sessions, manage wallet)
- Admin dashboard (view metrics, manage institutions)
- Booking flow with payment
- Review submission

## 📝 Testing

### Test Accounts Needed:
1. Admin user (assign 'admin' role in user_roles table)
2. Mentor account (create expert_profile)
3. Student account (regular user)

### Test Flows:
1. ✅ Student searches for mentors
2. ✅ Student books a session
3. ✅ Mentor confirms session (generates meet link)
4. ✅ Mentor completes session (triggers wallet credit)
5. ✅ Student leaves review
6. ✅ Mentor views wallet and transactions
7. ✅ Admin views dashboard metrics

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Type Errors**: New tables aren't in types.ts yet - will auto-sync after Supabase processes migrations
2. **Vector Search**: Requires manual pgvector extension enable
3. **Payments**: Placeholder only - needs Stripe integration
4. **Meet Links**: Placeholder URLs - needs video API
5. **Withdrawals**: Manual processing - needs payment gateway integration
