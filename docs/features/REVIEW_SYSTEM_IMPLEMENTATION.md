# Review Request System Implementation

## Overview

This system automatically sends review request emails to students 30 minutes after their session completes. Students can then rate and review their mentors, which appears in both the mentor dashboard and public profile.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Migration (`supabase/migrations/20251230120000_add_review_request_system.sql`)

**New Columns:**

- `bookings.review_requested_at` - Timestamp when review email was sent
- `reviews.helpful_count` - Community feedback counter (future feature)
- `reviews.is_featured` - Flag for exceptional reviews

**New Functions:**

- `get_sessions_ready_for_review()` - Returns completed sessions ready for review requests
- `mark_review_requested(booking_id)` - Marks booking as email sent
- `get_mentor_rating_stats(mentor_id)` - Returns detailed rating breakdown

**Updated RLS Policies:**

- Students can create reviews for their completed bookings
- Anyone can view reviews
- Users can update their reviews within 30 days
- Users can delete their reviews within 7 days

### 2. Edge Function (`supabase/functions/send-review-requests/index.ts`)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or manually in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
# Copy and run: supabase/migrations/20251230120000_add_review_request_system.sql
```

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Function

```bash
# Deploy the send-review-requests function
supabase functions deploy send-review-requests

# Verify deployment
supabase functions list
```

### Step 3: Set Up Cron Job

**Option A: Supabase Cron (Recommended)**

In your Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to Database → Extensions
2. Enable `pg_cron` extension
3. Run this SQL:

```sql
-- Schedule to run every 15 minutes
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'send-review-requests',
  '*/15 * * * *',
  $$
  SELECT
    net.http_post(
      url := 'https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-review-requests',
      headers := '{"Content-Type": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"}'::jsonb
    ) AS request_id;
  $$
);
```

**Option B: External Cron Service**

Use services like:

- Cron-job.org
- EasyCron
- GitHub Actions

Schedule GET/POST to:
`https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-review-requests`

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → Configuration:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### Step 5: Test the System

**Test Email Sending:**

```bash
# Invoke the function manually
supabase functions invoke send-review-requests
```

**Test Review Submission:**

1. Log in as a student
2. Go to Dashboard → Sessions
3. Find a completed session
4. Click "Write Review"
5. Submit rating and feedback
6. Verify it appears in mentor dashboard and public profile
