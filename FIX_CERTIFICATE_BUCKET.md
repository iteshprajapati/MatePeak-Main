# Fix: Certificate Upload Bucket Not Found

## Problem

The certificate upload feature is failing with "bucket not found" error because the `teaching-certificates` storage bucket hasn't been created in Supabase.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)

Run the SQL script directly in your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Open the file `fix-certificate-bucket.sql` in this repository
4. Copy all its contents
5. Paste into the SQL Editor
6. Click **Run** or press `Ctrl+Enter`
7. Verify that you see the bucket details in the results

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI (If you have it installed)

If you have the Supabase CLI installed and configured:

```powershell
# Navigate to your project directory
cd d:\Matepeak\Project\spark-mentor-connect-08475-37914-35681--84739

# Run the migration
supabase db push
```

### Option 3: Manual Creation via Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New bucket**
4. Set the following:
   - **Name**: `teaching-certificates`
   - **Public bucket**: âœ“ (checked)
   - **File size limit**: 20MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`
5. Click **Create bucket**
6. Then run the policies from `fix-certificate-bucket.sql` in the SQL Editor (lines 22-61)

## What This Creates

### Storage Bucket

- **Name**: `teaching-certificates`
- **Public access**: Yes (for viewing certificates on profiles)
- **Max file size**: 20MB
- **Allowed formats**: JPG, PNG

### Security Policies

- Users can only upload, update, and delete their own certificates
- Anyone can view certificates (for public profiles)
- File paths include user ID for organization: `{userId}/certificates/{timestamp}.{ext}`

## Verification

After running the fix, verify the bucket exists:

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. You should see `teaching-certificates` bucket listed
3. Try uploading a certificate through your app

3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Ensure file meets requirements (JPG/PNG, <20MB)
